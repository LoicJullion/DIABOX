Matlab software to create and run inverse box models for physical oceanography

This codes has merged various inverse modelling codes used across the globe. It all started from the DOBOX software from CSIRO in Hobart, Australia (Steve Rintoul, Peter McIntosh, Bernadette Sloyan). Various other groups have adapted this original code (Rick Lumpkin and Kevin Speer, FSU; Elaine McDonagh, Brian King and Takamasa Tsubouchi, NOCS; Alberto Naveira Garabato, UEA/Univ. of Southampton; and myself, Loic Jullion). This version comes from Rick Lumpkin's and Kevin Speer's code used for the global inverse model (Lumpkin and Speer, 2007, JPO).

I was hoping to release a more elaborate version of this code but since I am leaving oceanography, I thought it would be better to put it out there and fix bugs as they are found. 

Note about ancillary data used: Data are accessible here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4waZ_U9aflQU1pxWWNNSENocHc

This is a pretty big archive containing ERA-Interim data, ocean climatologies, river inputs and bathymetry. Users can use their preferred data set as long as they modify the mfiles reading the data.
